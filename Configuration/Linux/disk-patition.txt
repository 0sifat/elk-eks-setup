## Steps to Partition and Mount a Disk in Linux

### 1. Check Available Disks
Run the following command to list all available disks:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

### 2. Check the File System of the Disk Volume
Before proceeding, verify whether a file system exists on the disk:
```bash
sudo file -s /path/to/disk
```
**Note:** If the output shows `/path/to/disk: data`, this means no file system exists.

### 3. Create a File System on the Disk
If the disk has no file system, create one using the `mkfs` command (for XFS file system):
```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /path/to/disk
```

### 4. Verify the File System
Run the file command again to confirm that the file system has been created:
```bash
sudo file -s /path/to/disk
```
**Expected Output:** SGI XFS filesystem data (dlksz 4096, inosz 512, v2 dirs)

### 5. Create a Directory for Mounting
If the directory does not already exist, create it:
```bash
sudo mkdir /mydirectory
```

### 6. Mount the Disk
Mount the newly formatted disk to the created directory:
```bash
sudo mount /path/to/disk /mydirectory
```

### 7. Verify the Mounted Disk
Check if the disk is successfully mounted:
```bash
sudo df -h
```

### 8. Configure Persistent Mounting (Optional but Recommended)
To ensure the disk remains mounted after a reboot, add an entry in `/etc/fstab`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
/path/to/disk  /mydirectory  xfs  defaults  0  0
```
Save and exit the file.

### 9. Apply and Test the fstab Configuration
Run the following command to apply and verify the changes:
```bash
sudo mount -a
```

This process ensures that your disk is properly partitioned, formatted, mounted, and persists after reboot.
